## Learning Goals

* measure the performance of Ruby code
* determine why one instruction could be slower or faster than several instructions
* show how size of dataset can impact the performance of code
* benchmark various tasks (getting data from RAM, disk, API)


## Agenda

* 2 min - Goals
* 15 min - Benchmarking Intro
* 20 min - Playing with Benchmark
* 15 min - Profiling Intro
* 15 min - Playing with Profiling
* 45 min - Profiling Sales Engine
* 5 min - Wrap up 

## Materials
* [Repo](https://github.com/rwarbelow/performance_of_code)


## Key Points

* Code is not free.
* All instructions are not created equally. 


## Tools

* Benchmark (built into Ruby)
* Profile (built into Ruby)
* Ruby-Prof (Gem)
